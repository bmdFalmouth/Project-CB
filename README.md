# Project-CB
This a story-based horror game for the playdate. You play as a young girl in modern day New England who stumbles on an Old CB Radio, it suddenly springs to life and intrigued you start browsing the various channels. Before too long, you start hearing mysterious phrases and blood curddling chants. Explore the channels and piece together the mystery!

**Please use paper and pen/pencil to attempt to solve the mystery**

## Code base
This has been developed using the template that can be found here - https://github.com/Whitebrim/VSCode-PlaydateTemplate using the VS Code plugin - https://github.com/orta/vscode-playdate 

### Sprite Management
All code to display objects (sprites & text) is contained Sprite/sprite.lua, there a few classes in there that can be used for any Playdate project

### Scene Management
All code to display scene (collections of sprites & game/menu logic) is contained in Scene/scene.lua. You can extend the scene class for your own menu/game logic. See mainMenu.lua and project-CB.lua for an example

### Tools
I have created a few python scripts to help manage game data, these are:

- **StoryGenerator.py**: This takes in an excel file and then generates a json file, this is used to control the story. This can be changed in order to make new stories for the game

- **DialogueGenerator.py**: This again uses an excel file as input, it use the Google Text to Voice API to generate some test dialogue. This is used to prototype the story

It is recommended to use a Virtual Envirnoment(https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to use these tools, all librarys can be install via pip using the **requirements.txt** file (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-requirementstxt-explained/)
